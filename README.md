# RazorEnhancedScripts

This is my bundle of script for Razor Enhanced, Some are useful, some not so much, as they are designed for a very specific purpose upon request from someone.

I would mainly recomend you look at
Lootmaster and SlayerBar

They are the ones that would benefit most people.

## Lootmaster

This is an autolooter that uses a set of rules, each rule has it's own settings, and each characters has his or hers own ruleset
More info on how this works can be found here

## SlayerBar

This is a hotbar script. it will look though your skills to find your primary damage skill,
then check your enventory for a bag that contains slayers on weapons that matches that skill.

It will then generate a bar with buttons, clicking hese buttons will swap to the corresponding slayer,  and return your current weapon to the previously designated slayer bag.

It's highly recomended to put all your players in a designated bag, rather than having them loose in your backpack, The backpack works,
but if you might have multiple slayers of the same type and thus the script would list both.
